# TicTacToe

A simple tic tac toe game.
<h3>TODO:</h3>
- [ ] Rotate with proper height and width

- [x] Savestates

- [ ] put the wongame() at the end of the mainactivity so the game knows who won after a button has been pressed _and not at a new buttonpress_

- [ ] figure out how to do Task lists in MarkDown

- [ ] display "win" or "draw" message
